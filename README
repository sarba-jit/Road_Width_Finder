This program uses defisheye algorithm to convert a 360 degree image into a 90 degree field of view.
It then lets the user select the region whose width needs to be calculated.

The selection should be within the rectangular box. This helps to map the 
selected pixel values to corresponding measurement in feet.

In order to select the region, start at a point on the image by right clicking on the mouse and then drag it down imagining the diagonal of the rectangle box.
If the box selection was not correct, "Press r" to redo and if the selection was as desired "Press c" to exit and view the result.
